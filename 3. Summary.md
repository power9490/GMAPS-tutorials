## 7. Summary and personal assessment of the library
	Until now, We have learned about gmaps from installing to usages. 
	As introduced before, gmaps is a libarary which can help visualizing maps through Google maps.
	We can use most of useful features of Google maps including searching, notifying and so on.
	We have tried to show you as easy and specifically as we can but it could be little tricky. 
	If you need more help or questions, please contact us or follow the references. 
	Also you will be able to get enough infomation through internet search.
	gmaps may need you API key and it could cause payment.
	However this library is definitely useful and can enforce your business better

	Other libararies for visualization mapping, they needs data file which contains that region's map information
	and we can only see that scene
	However for gmaps we can use simply by applying only lattitute and longitute information. 
	And moreover we can use several useful features of Google maps.
	Except for specific purpose of map visualization, I think this libarary is the most vasatile and useful, easy applicapable library. If you are free from API problem.
	It will be better if this library has a function that can only show outline of the city or countries border line.
