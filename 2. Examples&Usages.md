## 4. Minimal working example
### 4-1. heatmap layer
[examples](https://github.com/power9490/GMAPS-tutorials/blob/origin/JUPYTER/4.%20examples/gmaps.ipynb)

## 5. 2-3 examples of typical use-cases
### 5-0. Basic map
[Usage0](https://github.com/power9490/GMAPS-tutorials/blob/origin/JUPYTER/5.%20use-cases/Usage%201.ipynb)


### 5-1. Mark layer using starbucks dataÂ¶

## 6. List other interesting or useful features (additional examples are not required)
### 6-1. Custom Control
User can magnify or diminish gmaps output customly. User can move the focus of map 
and find where they want to see just same as using google map

(https://github.com/power9490/GMAPS-tutorials/blob/origin/DATASET/photo/additional_features/2.PNG)

### 6-2. Street view and Satalite view
Not only user can move there map customly, but also user can use google maps street view service.
User can experience panorama view of real street. And also can use satellite view

### 6-3. Polygon and Poliline
With using gmaps library, User can notify specific place on the map several ways. 
One of that is making poliline or polygon by adding layer.

### 6-4. Others
And moreover, many features including Geocoding, Timezone, Elevation are there.
